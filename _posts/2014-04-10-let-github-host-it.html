I've been looking into creating my own personal landing page and pointing my sethjmoore.com domain there, rather than at my <a href="http://sethjmoore.flavors.me/">Flavors.me page</a>. This would allow me to brush up on my web development skills and work toward having a more useful page without having to start paying <a href="http://flavors.me/">Flavors.me</a>&nbsp;for more than their basic functionality. It seemed that I would have to start paying for hosting somewhere else, but then I found out about <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, where I could host my website as a git repository and serve from my domain for free. So today I created a basic landing page and set up my DNS so that <a href="http://www.sethjmoore.com/">www.sethjmoore.com</a> goes to it. It's a start.
