We headed down to El Salvador, where we stayed at the <a href="http://www.wavehunters.com/el-salvador-surfing/las-flores-surf-club/index.php">Las Flores Surf Club</a>. We had exceptional accommodations and service with a beautiful point break that we could see from our balcony. We took boats to Punta Bongo break on three mornings, where we had the waves all to ourselves. If anyone is looking to take a surf trip, this is a destination worth looking into.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=96816&amp;id=776124233&amp;l=3b4b7e1b29">Click here for some photos.</a>
