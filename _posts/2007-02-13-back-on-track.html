I'm gonna try to pull this blog a bit back on track. My original purpose for this blog was to put up quick pictures from my life, not pictures of me, so I'm going to try to get back in that habit. If you want to continue following my 365 daily self-portraits you can do so <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/97901682@N00/">Here</a><br /><br />Here's a thought... Send me a text message on my cell phone periodically saying something like "Take a picture!" and I'll try to take a picture and send it here right away. This will remind me to do so at times I might not have otherwise thought of it.
