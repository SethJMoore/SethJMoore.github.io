When I <a href="http://blog.munjaros.com/2009/11/must-do-create.html">posted</a> about needing to create more, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Zech-Moore-Designs/166080140095858">my brother</a> commented that I could record some music for him to put in his metal working videos. It took me a while, but I ended up putting something together back in 2010, and I'm finally posting about it now.<br /><br />With the help of two guitars, my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pod_(amp_modeler)">POD</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audacity_(audio_editor)">Audacity</a>, this is what I came up with:<br /><iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/138068219&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true" width="100%"></iframe><br /><br />And this is the video that Zech put it in. It's the beginning of a metal dragon he's making that looks like it will be even cooler than the other dragons he's made.<br /><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="270" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/DcguncGHZRo" width="480"></iframe>
