On Friday night I completed the qualifying round of this year's <a href="https://code.google.com/codejam/">Google Code Jam</a>. This year I figured I'd share my submissions via <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. It took me five hours to solve the three problems that I did, and I only succeeded on the small problem set for the Cookie Cutter Alpha problem, but I earned enough points to qualify, so we'll see how I do in Round 1. Anyway, if you're interested in my submissions so far, you can find them <a href="https://github.com/SethJMoore/GoogleCodeJam2014">here</a>, and I'll post a follow up after Round 1.
