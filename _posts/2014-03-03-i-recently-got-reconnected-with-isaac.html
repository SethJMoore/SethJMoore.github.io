I recently got reconnected with <a href="http://isaacvanier.net/">Isaac Vanier</a>&nbsp;after being out of contact with him for a few years, and his posts about the <a href="http://worldsbelow.com/shadows/">game he's working on</a>&nbsp;have inspired me to get back on the blogging bandwagon (at least for a little bit). I should be posting about a few game projects I dabbled with in 2012, and I'll do a follow up about what resulted from my <a href="http://blog.munjaros.com/2009/11/must-do-create.html">post about needing to create more</a>.<br /><br />As for what I've been up to since my last <a href="http://blog.munjaros.com/2010/08/hey-amber.html">post in 2010</a>, I got myself a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science">BS</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science">MS</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">CS</a>, and that process seems to have occupied most of my time.
