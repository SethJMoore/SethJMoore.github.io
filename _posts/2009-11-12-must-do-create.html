I've been thinking lately about imposing a daily requirement on myself. Something like "I must create for one hour per day." I see the stuff that my brother <a href="http://southclaw.blogspot.com/">does</a> (no picture there of the cool new <i>knife he made</i> yet), my sister <a href="http://randomamby.blogspot.com/">too</a> (ask to see some of her drawings or journal covers, maybe she'll post them to her blog), or my friend Micaiah's <a href="http://ilorien.blogspot.com/">musings</a> (you must read his <a href="http://ilorien.blogspot.com/2009/09/ingourious-basterds-valuable-reminder.html">post</a> on violence in movies)(oh yeah, he paints too), and I either feel inspired or a bit discouraged about my slackitude. I need to get back on that creative train! The last significant creative thing I did was my album <a href="http://drop.io/pluckings">Pluckings</a> back in 2000 I think. There has been a little creativity, such as periodic posts here, or the 365 daily self-portraits, but I need to make some rules to ensure that I move some of the time I spend on consuming over to creating. Any recommendations on what I should require of myself?
