I've been playing around with Google Wave and figured I'd try embedding a wave here using the Madoqua Wave Bot. I'm sorry that those of you without Google Wave (which probably means all two or three people who actually follow this blog) won't currently be able to see or interact with the wave, but I'm sure that you, too, will be able to get your Wave accounts before too long.<br /><br />UPDATE: Hmm, not working yet. Let's see what I can do here...<br /><br />UPDATE: Oh well, I'm gonna abandon this attempt for now. I'll wait until they get Bloggy working again and maybe try this again in another post.
