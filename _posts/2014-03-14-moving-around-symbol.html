Having done this back in 2011, I don't recall what got me started on it, but 3D Position (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wnup1nh0b6ywv8k/3D_Position.exe">download executable</a>&nbsp;or check out the C++&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/SethJMoore/3D-Position">source code</a>) allows a player to navigate an '@' symbol around an 18x18x18 cave using the 'h', 'j', 'k', and 'l' keys. (I think I was getting used to using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>&nbsp;at the time, which would explain my choice of navigation keys.) What I find interesting and might think about exploring again sometime, is the limited perception of the world, where the player has to rely on only knowing what is located in a straight line on each axis from the character.<br /><br />I don't know if the executable will work for everyone, so if you decide to check it out, let me know if it does or doesn't.<br /><br />The controls are as follows:<br /><br /><ul><li>h - One block lower on the x axis</li><li>l - One block higher on the x axis</li><li>j - One block lower on the y axis</li><li>k - One block higher on the y axis</li><li>J - One block lower on the z axis</li><li>K - One block higher on the z axis</li><li>q - Quit</li></ul>
